# HackThisSite - Basic Mission 1

## Objective
Bypass a basic login form using knowledge of HTML and simple inspection.

## What I Learned
- How to view and interpret HTML source code
- Understanding how forms and inputs are submitted to servers
- Recognizing simple hardcoded credentials in the code

## Tools Used
- Browser DevTools

## Solution Summary
Discovered that the username and password were hardcoded in the HTML source of the page. Used those credentials to log in successfully.

## Key Takeaway
Always check the client-side code — early challenges teach you how often sensitive data is exposed where it shouldn’t be.
