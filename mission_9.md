# HackThisSite - Basic Mission 9

## 🧠 Objective
Bypass a JavaScript-based input filter.

## 🔍 What I Learned
- JavaScript filters can be evaded through encoding or unexpected characters
- Basic encoding (e.g. Unicode, URL) can be used to bypass naive filters

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- DevTools Console
- Encoding tools

## ✅ Solution Summary
Used encoding to send input that bypassed the JS filter and satisfied the server-side check.

## 💡 Key Takeaway
Client-side input filters can be fooled — robust input validation must happen on the server.
