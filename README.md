# HackThisSite – Missions Writeups

This repository documents my solutions and lessons learned from the Missions on [HackThisSite.org](https://www.hackthissite.org/). These challenges introduce fundamental web security concepts, including:

- HTML and JavaScript inspection  
- Client-side authentication flaws  
- Cookie manipulation and tampering  
- URL and input-based attacks  
- Directory traversal and misconfigurations
