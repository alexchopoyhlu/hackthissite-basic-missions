# Basic Mission 9 – JS-Based Obfuscation & Logic

**Objective:** Extract password from complex JS logic.

---

## Approach

1. Study the JS carefully — often involves math or encoding.
2. Deobfuscate it using DevTools or an online JS interpreter.
3. Derive the password.

---

## Solution Steps

- Copy the JS to an editor or browser console.
- Run through each step to understand logic.
- Reveal the password and submit.

---

## Concept

This mission demonstrates how to trace and decode slightly more complex client-side logic.

---

## Takeaways

- Reading and testing JS logic can reveal secrets.
- Even obfuscated JS is not secure against inspection.
