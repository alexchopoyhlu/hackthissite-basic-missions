# Basic Mission 4 – JS Obfuscation

**Objective:** Extract the password from obfuscated JavaScript.

---

## Approach

1. View the source or linked JavaScript file.
2. Decode basic obfuscation (string splitting, reversal, etc.).
3. Identify the password.

---

## Solution Steps

- Copy the JS to a code editor.
- Reverse or decode functions like `.split('').reverse().join('')`.
- Find the final password value.

---

## Concept

This mission shows how basic obfuscation can be decoded with minimal effort.

---

## Takeaways

- Obfuscation ≠ security.
- Always analyze scripts if access is gated by JS.
